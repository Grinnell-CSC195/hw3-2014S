Title: Tickle

Toby Baratta:

Site: http://processing.org/examples/tickle.html

Description:
When mouse moves over the world tickle, the word tickle reacts and moves away as if someone was tickling it.

Commentary:
Honestly I found this really hilarious as a concept and I liked the quick implementation of it. It seems like something that would be fun to play with if "tickle" was a link and moved quicker away from the mouse so that the mouse had no way of hovering over it. Or it if taunted the user.
